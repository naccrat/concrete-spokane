            How long does it take to complete a concrete repair project?
          </p>
          <p>
            The duration of a concrete repair project can vary depending on the size and complexity of the repair needed. Minor repairs, such as cracks or small areas, can often be completed within a day or two. Larger-scale repairs or extensive damage may require more time, ranging from several days to a week. Our team at All-Pro Concrete Spokane will assess your specific project and provide you with a timeline during the consultation process.

            How do I maintain and care for my newly installed concrete driveway?  
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure the longevity and appearance of your concrete driveway, it's important to follow some simple maintenance guidelines. Avoid using de-icing chemicals in winter, as they can damage the surface. Regularly sweep or rinse off debris and clean any spills promptly to prevent staining. It's also recommended to seal your concrete driveway every few years for added protection. Our team can provide you with specific maintenance recommendations based on your unique circumstances and the condition of your driveway.
